# Draghig - Learning Java Repo

A GitHub repository to post my learning progress in Java.


## ðŸš€ About Me
My name is Luke! I go by the screen name "Draghig". I'm new to software engineering, starting my journey using a course called MineAcademy (www.mineacademy.org) ran by Mataj Pacan. I'm using this repo as a way to A) track my progress and B) as a sort of reference notes to go along with my actual note taking!
